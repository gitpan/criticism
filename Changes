[1.02] Released on 2008-07-27

     Added support for the "fatal-criticism" option.  Setting this
     option in your .perlcriticrc file will cause your program to
     immediately die if any violations are found by the criticism
     pragma.  This release requires Perl-Critic-1.089 or higher.

[1.01] Released on 2007-01-24

     PRODUCTION RELEASE: You may now consider the public API of
     criticism.pm as stable.

     No code changes since last release.

[0.04] Released on 2006-11-05

     All arguments to Perl::Critic can now be passed through the
     criticism pragma.

     The default output format has changed slightly to match the
     output of "perl -c".  This enables EPIC users to integrate
     with Perl::Critic.

     Now requires Perl::Critic 0.21 or higher.

[0.03] Released 2006-01-30

     Now internally trapping failures to load Perl::Critic.  This saves
     developers from having to write ugly code that conditionally loads
     the criticism pragma.

     Revised documentation.

[0.02] Released 2006-01-15

     Fixed stupid bug.  Doh!

     Expanded documentation.

[0.01] Released 2006-01-14

     Initial release.  Enjoy!
