       This pragma runs your file through Perl::Critic before every execution.
       In practice, this isn't really feasible because it adds a great deal of
       overhead at start-up.  Unless you really don't mind the wait, you're
       probably better off using the perlcritic command-line or
       Test::Perl::Critic.
